# Doing Calculations using javascript.

In this repository we show how some mathematical calculations can be done using javascript, often embedded in an HTML file.
For example we have a distance calculator that takes as input the latitude and longitude for two points and works out the distance between them.
If you're intested in the mathematics used, then have a look at [this blog-post](https://abitofmaths.blogspot.com/2023/03/latitude-longitude-distances.html).
